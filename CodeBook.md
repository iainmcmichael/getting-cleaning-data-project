Tidied-Up "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" Data
=====================================================================

Study design
------------

This data is a tidied-up version of the original "Human Activity Recognition 
Using Smartphones Dataset" data.  It only includes mean and standard deviation 
measures and aggregates these by subject and activity taking the mean for each 
aggregated measurement.

I only include those columns that include "-mean()" or 
"-std()" in the name as these were described to be the mean value and standard 
deviation measures in features_info.txt.

In the fields below, "subject" is the subject ID and "activity" is the activity
the subject was engaged in when the measurements were taken.  The other fields
have the same labels, meanings, and units as they do in the original study.
