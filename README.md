When extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
measurement, I decided to only include those columns that include "-mean()-" or 
"-std()-".  Yes, some columns included "mean" without the hyphens and 
parentheses, but I think those were measurements that had "mean" in the name, 
rather than the mean of a measurement.  (Now you could have the mean of a 
measurement that included "mean" in the name and I did include those.)
